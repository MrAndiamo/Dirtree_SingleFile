# Select a directory, export it to a csv-file - one file...

My dad wants to make a lsit of all his music on his PC.
He wanted to do it with CMD, but I suggested I would make something for him.

Important is that it is one file or folder so it's easy to use.
Just mail it and tada, it already works...

I will make a second version everything stuffed in folder instead of loading from internet
or stuffing it in the HTML, so it will look nice and it's useable offline...

Greetings,
